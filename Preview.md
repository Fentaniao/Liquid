# Introduction to Liquid Theme

## Feature 

### Color

This theme **use color to indicate interactivity**. It's a good idea to choose one color to indicate elements of your application that are interactive. For example, many web pages use blue text to denote a hyperlink.

### Mica Material

Mica is an opaque material. I apply Mica to this theme to delight users and create visual hierarchy, aiding productivity, by increasing clarity about which window is in focus.

### Rounded Rectangle

In life, if the edges and corners of objects are too sharp, it is not safe. Industrial Angle, rounded/chamfered for easier assembly. Instead of sharp edges that make people feel cold, rounded corners make people feel more warm.
