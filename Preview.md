# Introducing Liquid Theme

## Feature

### Color

#### Colorful Indication

This theme **use color to indicate interactivity**. It's a good idea to choose one color to indicate elements of your application that are interactive. For example, many web pages use blue text to denote a hyperlink.

#### Gradient

Gradient is to draw a component by using two or more different colors, forming a harmonious transition between the colors. This is a hue that didn't exist before. It looks unique, modern and refreshing.

This [website](https://webkul.github.io/coolhue/) inspires me to use Gradient. 

### Mica Material

Mica is an opaque material. I apply Mica to this theme to delight users and create visual hierarchy, aiding productivity, by increasing clarity about which window is in focus.

### Rounded Rectangle

In life, if the edges and corners of objects are too sharp, it is not safe. Industrial Angle, rounded/chamfered for easier assembly. Instead of sharp edges that make people feel cold, rounded corners make people feel more warm.

#### Multi-Support

- Both English and Chinese. 

- Both light and dark mode, and also provide ink mode.
